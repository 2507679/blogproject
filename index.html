         <p>Exploring the world of robotics, from today's innovations to future possibilities.
            robotics, design, construction, and use of machines (robots) to perform tasks done traditionally by human beings. Robots are widely used in such industries as automobile manufacture to perform simple repetitive tasks, and in industries where work must be performed in environments hazardous to humans.</p>

        <h2>About Robotics</h2>
        <p>Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that integrates computer science, engineering, and artificial intelligence to create machines capable of performing tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. The field spans industrial applications, healthcare, household robotics, and more. Robotics aims to develop machines that can assist, augment, and sometimes replace human labor in various environments, offering efficiency, precision, and improved safety.</p>

    <section id="present">
        <h2>Present of Robotics</h2>
        <p>Currently, robotics is advancing rapidly, especially in areas such as automation, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Robots are increasingly present in manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. For instance, industrial robots are used to automate repetitive tasks in factories, while service robots are aiding in medical surgeries and patient care.</p>
        <p>Technologies such as AI-powered computer vision and natural language processing are making robots smarter and more capable of interacting with humans. Autonomous robots, like drones and self-driving vehicles, are becoming more common and are transforming industries by providing new ways to manage tasks.</p>

    <!-- Future of Robotics Section -->
    <section id="future">
        <h2>Future of Robotics</h2>
        <p>The future of robotics holds exciting possibilities. As AI and robotics technology continue to evolve, robots are expected to become even more integrated into our daily lives. Future advancements might lead to robots that can perform complex emotional and cognitive tasks, collaborate closely with humans in various environments, and even engage in creative processes.</p>
        <p>In the coming decades, robotics will likely transform fields such as healthcare with robotic-assisted therapies, education with robotic tutors, and even space exploration with autonomous robotic explorers. The continued development of human-robot interaction will also make robots more adaptable and useful in a wider range of settings.</p>

        <!-- Work of Robotics Section -->
        <section id="Work">
            <h2>Work of Robotics</h2>
     <p>A robot is made up of the very same components. A basic typical robot has a movable physical structure, a motor of some sort, a sensor system, a power supply and a computer "brain" that controls all of these elements. Essentially, robots are human-made versions of animal life â€” they are machines that replicate human and animal behavior.</p>
